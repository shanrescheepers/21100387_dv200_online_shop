Tasked to create an ecommerce web app for a client that is a wildlife and conservation enthusiast, with a modern and simplistic ui layout build, incorporating and building it with react mongo db  Atlas and mui
requirements included:
add products to a cart using local and session storage
calculate total price upon checkout
dispatch section for admin panel




in my ideation phase i decided on a wildlife gallery to sell wildlife photographs as key product, using various images by inspirational guides and conservationists in the industry.
The theme derived from my passion as an ex safari guide, with fellow conservationists and guides i call friends. This app is was a great startup for a future passion project deployed in real life.
with conservation in mind, the delivery cost is set with the total price.
